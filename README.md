# License Plate Observation System

> Are you a law enforcement officer? Maybe you're a citizen who just likes to have a dashcam running in your vehicle? This system is for you. Using as little processing power as possible, I've created a system which can detect license plates through images or videos.

<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p id="about-the-project">This project was inspired by my daily observations while driving for a produce delivery company. There are many drivers on the road today, and the majority do not respect the box trucks around them. This project is my answer to this disrespect. Deployment on a Raspberry Pi is simple, lightweight, and fast. </p>

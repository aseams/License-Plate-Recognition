SCRIPTS:
enhance.py
  Input image. Output same image
  with higher resolution.
feature_match.py
  Look at input image to match its
  features with a known real plate
license_plate.py
  Find plate in image using Haar
  Make red border and overlay image
  of captured area on top
lpr.py
  my attempt at recognition
TestLPR.py
  Downloaded script to input image of vehicle
  and get output of license plate value
vidTest.py
  Takes input of video and displays it
  on screen with rectangles showing
  possible plates captured. Also saves
  these captures as image files.

IMAGES/VIDEOS:
/cropped_vehicle
  Contains output from vidTest.py as
  well as output from enhance.py

Cropped images of license plates:
  LICENSE_PLATE.PNG    [real plate]
  standard.jpg         [example plate]
testVideo.mp4
  10 second vid of vehicle [portrait]

OTHER FILES:
Deep Neural Network used for upscaling images:
  EDSR_x3.pb	   [x3 - VERY SLOW]
  LapSRN_x4.pb     [x4 - KINDA QUICK]

DIRECTORIES
cascade_dir
  Contains shortcut to cv2 HaarCascades as well
  as multiple stages of cascade generation of
  US pates.
cropped_vehicle
  Generated by vidTest.lpr to contain captured
  frames containing license plate/rear of vehicle
detection
  Contains all images with detected plates given
  to TestLPR.py
Example Outputs
  Contains "promotional material" for the system
plates
  Contains cropped down images of the detected
  plate as seen by TestLPR.py
preprocess
  Contains all preprocessed images given
  to TestLPR.py
Tensorflow Does NOT Work
  A subtle reminder that the current version
  of Python will not work with Tensorflow
  because TF dependancies have not all
  been updated
